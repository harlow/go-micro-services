# Attention

This is a fork, so it's not go get-able, you'll have to setup the project structure as the original,
e.g.

    git clone https://github.com/isaiah/go-micro-services.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/harlow/

# HTTP up front, Protobufs in the rear.

An demonstration of Golang micro-services that accept HTTP/JSON requests at API level and then
leverage [gRPC][1] for inter-service communication.

![new_sequence](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/739782/7439604/d1f324c2-f036-11e4-958a-6f6913049946.png)

The API Endpoint accepts HTTP requests on port `5000` and then spawns a number of RPC requests to the backend services.

_Note:_ Data for each of the services is stored in JSON flat files under the `/data/` directory. In reality each of the services could choose their own specialty datastore. The Geo service for example could use PostGis or any other database specializing in geospacial queries.

### Installation

Protobuf v3 are required:

    $ brew install protobuf --devel
    
Install the protoc-gen libraries:

    $ go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/{proto,protoc-gen-go}

Clone the repository:

    $ git clone git@github.com:harlow/go-micro-services.git

If changes are made to the Protocol Buffers a Make file can be used to regenerate:

    $ make -s

### Bootstrap the services

To make the demo as straigforward as possible; docker is used to run all the services. In a production environment each of the services would be run (and scaled) independently.

    make build
    docker-compose up

Curl the endpoint with an invalid auth token:

    $ curl http://localhost:5000 -H "Authorization: Bearer INVALID_TOKEN"
    Unauthorized

Curl the endpoint without checkin or checkout dates:

    $ curl "http://localhost:5000?inDate=2015-04-09" -H "Authorization: Bearer VALID_TOKEN"
    Please specify outDate

Curl the API endpoint with a valid auth token:

    $ curl "http://localhost:5000?inDate=2015-04-09&outDate=2015-04-10" -H "Authorization: Bearer VALID_TOKEN"

The JSON response:

```json

    "hotels": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Clift Hotel",
